PACMAN
======

This is a utility that is fun to have. After you compile the source code
add the application to your `/usr/bin` folder **(if you're an ArchLinux
user, beware of replacing the package manager, also pacman, application!)** and then add it in the
`~/.bashrc` so it runs everytime you lunch the terminal!
